# Loan-status-prediction-
The main objective of the Project is to compare the Loan Prediction
Models made implemented using various algorithms and choose the best one
out of them that can shorten the loan approval time and decrease the risk
associated with it. It is done by predicting if the loan can be given to that
person on the basis of various parameters like credit score, income, age,
marital status, gender, etc. The prediction model not only helps the
applicant but also helps the bank by minimizing the risk and reducing the
number of defaulters.
